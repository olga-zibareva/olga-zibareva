Hello! :wave: 

My name is Olga. I like to immerse myself in the world of technologies and learn new things. I love the feeling of accomplishment when I solve a difficult task, and it fuels me to progress further.

I have always enjoyed solving problems in **mathematics** and **statistics**, helping students write term papers and essays in these disciplines. Eventually, I got myself diving deep into **Data Science**, then completed the study and got the profession of Data Science Specialist. The desire to grow as a professional pushes me forward to master large data analysis, machine learning and other topics.

My primary tool is *Python*. I work in *Jupyter Notebook*, and my toolbox includes libraries such as *pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *scikit-learn* and more.
